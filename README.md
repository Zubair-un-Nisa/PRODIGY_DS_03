**Task-03
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.**
In the first step of data analysis and visualization, I import various libraries such as 'pandas' for data manipulation and  'matplotlib' for visualization, to perform tasks efficiently because libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for data manipulation and visualization.
In the second step, I uploaded datasets into the analysis environment. Because uploading datasets provides the raw material for analysis. 
In the third step, I understand the characteristics of the dataset. I explore the basic information about the data such as reviewing the first few rows of the dataset, obtaining summary statistics, and checking data types are preliminary steps in understanding your data.
In the fourth step, separate the dependent and independent variables
In the fifth step, split the data to train and test
In the sixth step, implement the decision tree model
In the seventh step, check the accuracy of the model
In the last step, check the prediction of the model
